# Definition

## Linux

    An operaing system which is most used and most important on the planet.

- It powers web, infracstructure, largest supercomputers, ...
- Developing for Linux can be a bit of a challenge, but it can also be extremely rewarding

## Shell

    A program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform

- On most Linux system, a program called [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (Bourne Again SHell)
- Besides, others include: `ksh,tcsh` and `zsh` 

## Terminal

    A program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell

- Most Linux distros supply several: `gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, rxvt, kvt, nxterm, eterm`

**File System Organization**

</p>

    In Linux, the files are arranged in hierarchical directory structure

- In other words, they are organized in a `tree-like pattern of directories`
- The first directory is called `root directory`, which contains files and subdirectories and so on.
- Linux doesn't employee the concept of drive letters (which splits file system into a series of different trees)
- Different storage devices may contain different branches of the tree, however, Linux always has <mark>a single tree</mark>

**pwd**

    Find current working directory

- At any moment, you are located in a single directory
- Inside that directory, you can see its files and the pathway to its `parent directory` and the pathway to the `subdirectories` in which you are standing
- When you first log on to a Linux system, the working directory 

![pwd](assets/images/pwd.png)

**cd**

    Change working directory

- Type `cd` followed by the `pathname` of the desired working directory

- `pathname` can be specified in one of two different ways
  
  - `absolute pathnames`: begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch by branch until the path to the desired directory or file is completed
  - `relative pathnames`: starts from working directory. To do this, it uses a couple of special notations to represent relative positions in the file system tree
    - "." notation refers to the working directory itself
    - ".." notation refers to the working directory's parent directory

- Shortcuts
  
  - `cd followed by nothing`: change directory to your home directory.
  - `cd ~user_name`: change working directory to home directory of specified user.
  - `cd -`: change working directory to previous one.

## Looking around

**ls**

    List the contents of a directory

| Command         | Results                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ls              | List the files in pwd                                         |
| ls /Desktop     | List the files in the /Desktop directory                      |
| ls -l           | List files in pwd in long format                              |
| ls -l /etc /bin | List files in /bin and /etc directories in long format        |
| ls -la          | List files (even ones beginning with a period - hidden files) |

**Long format**

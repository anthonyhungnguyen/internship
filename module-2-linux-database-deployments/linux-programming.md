## Linux

    An operaing system which is most used and most important on the planet.

- It powers web, infracstructure, largest supercomputers, ...
- Developing for Linux can be a bit of a challenge, but it can also be extremely rewarding

## Shell

    A program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform

- On most Linux system, a program called [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (Bourne Again SHell)
- Besides, others include: `ksh,tcsh` and `zsh` 

## Terminal

    A program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell

- Most Linux distros supply several: `gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, rxvt, kvt, nxterm, eterm`

**File System Organization**

</p>

    In Linux, the files are arranged in hierarchical directory structure

- In other words, they are organized in a `tree-like pattern of directories`
- The first directory is called `root directory`, which contains files and subdirectories and so on.
- Linux doesn't employee the concept of drive letters (which splits file system into a series of different trees)
- Different storage devices may contain different branches of the tree, however, Linux always has <mark>a single tree</mark>

**pwd**

    Find current working directory

- At any moment, you are located in a single directory
- Inside that directory, you can see its files and the pathway to its `parent directory` and the pathway to the `subdirectories` in which you are standing
- When you first log on to a Linux system, the working directory 

![pwd](assets/images/pwd.png)

**cd**

    Change working directory

- Type `cd` followed by the `pathname` of the desired working directory

- `pathname` can be specified in one of two different ways
  
  - `absolute pathnames`: begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch by branch until the path to the desired directory or file is completed
  - `relative pathnames`: starts from working directory. To do this, it uses a couple of special notations to represent relative positions in the file system tree
    - "." notation refers to the working directory itself
    - ".." notation refers to the working directory's parent directory

- Shortcuts
  
  - `cd followed by nothing`: change directory to your home directory.
  - `cd ~user_name`: change working directory to home directory of specified user.
  - `cd -`: change working directory to previous one.

## I/O Direction

**Standard Output**

    To redirect standard output to a file

- `>` - to redirect standard output to a file (overwritten if exists)
- '>>' - to append to a file

**Standard Input**


    To redirect standard input from a file

- `<` - to get contents of file for processing
- `< ... >`- to get contents of file for processing and pass the results to a fle

**Pipelines**

    Connect multiple commands together. The standard output of one command is fed into the standard input of another

- Command: `|`
- Example: `ls -l | less`

**Filters**

    Take standard input and perform an operation on it and send the results to standard ouput
